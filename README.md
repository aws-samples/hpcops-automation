## HPC Ops - Automate Your HPC Infrastructure with AWS ParallelCluster and AWS CloudFormation

HPC Ops combining the concept of DevOps, IaC and cloud computing provides numerous advantages in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. By automating repetitive tasks, HPC administrators can focus their efforts on more complex challenges and innovations. Automation increases efficiency by reducing human error and allowing tasks to be completed faster. It also improves repeatability, consistency and reliability in operations allowing scaling more easily as the workloads grow. Common uses for HPC Ops include automated provisioning of compute resources, automated deployment of applications, automated monitoring and alerting, and workflow scheduling automation. It also facilitates integration with cloud services and on-demand resources.  Automation has become a critical enabler for delivering high-performance computing services in a consistent and scalable manner in the cloud.

In this post, weâ€™ll demonstrate how easily it is to implement an automated HPC Ops deployment using AWS Managed Services.
